THIS PLUGIN CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS ON LATEST SPIGOT BUILD
AS A FIX WAS REQUIRED FOR THIS PLUGIN TO WORK.
(if you are on paper, you need to wait for upstream merge)

Connects multiple minecraft servers via master server, cookie packets and transfers

Contributions are welcome, we aim to provide bukkit, bungeecord and velocity support at first.

This software is still work in progress.

This software aims to provide a minecraft server network functionallity utilizing the transfer and cookie packets to
create a fast and secure way of data transfer and transfer of players to different servers.

You first need to start the server and copy the secret key from the server config into all plugin configs of the
minecraft servers.
Do not share this secret key!

IF YOU LEAKED THE KEY, PLEASE REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE MASTER SERVER CONFIG AND GENERATE A NEW ONE. (BY RESTARTING
